        <h2 class="summary"><i>Summary</i></h2>
        <div class="summaryText">
        Due to my interest in Speech and Debate throughout high-school I have always been a performer who sought to understand the stories of others and this is what led me to pursure a Bachelor of Science in Brain and Cognitive Science, to further grasp interpersonal and personal development of myself and those around me. I am a current Sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with a greater interest in cognitive processing and understanding the basis for human behavior, reasoning, technological interaction and socialization with an interdisciplinary approach to Cognitive Science. Due to my profound interest in the Psychological/Cognitive Sciences I hope to one day pursue a PhD in Psychology, as well as attend law school. I am very passionate about my pre-law experiences, including my involvement in Kappa Alpha Pi: Professional Pre-Law Fraternity. In my free time I enjoy getting to explore campus and fuel my creativity by painting, drawing, photography, and even recently diving into the world of coding and digital art.</p>
        In my experience as a member of my high school's Speech and Debate team, I excelled at active communication, and strived for the most effective interpersonal interaction. My acting through Speech and Debate instilled a sense of empathy that I still carry to this day, and I consider it a great honor to have shared the stories of many others through that platform.
